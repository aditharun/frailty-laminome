A quick guide to using the scripts in this directory

analysis.R compute the change in protein abundance between IL-10 KO and WT mice for a given tissue type from the proteome data. Navigate to the code/ directory and run 'Rscript analysis.R {sample}' where {sample} takes one of heart, muscle, or brain. 

get_gene_names.R uses the NCBI API to turn each accession number into a gene name. It is to be run on the outputs of analysis.R sitting in temp/. Navigate to the code/ directory and run 'Rscript get_gene_names.R {sample}' where {sample} takes one of heart, muscle, or brain. It stores each query so that any NCBI API outages or rate-limiting stops does not affect the program. 

venn-diagram.R computes the number of proteins jointly identified by each combination of tissues. 

volcano-stratification.R generates a volcano plot (log2FC vs. -log10p-value) for the differential protein abundance analysis, an interactive plotly version of this stored in results/interactive/, and a plot showing the difference in abundance between KO and WT for each identified protein. Navigate to the code/ directory and run 'Rscript volcano-stratification.R {sample}' where {sample} takes one of heart, muscle, or brain. It stores each query so that any NCBI API outages or rate-limiting stops does not affect the program.


weight-analysis.R analyzes the weights of the different organs in the sacrificed organisms and generates a figure describing these weights.
